        - [ ] compile the CSS resources using Laravel Mix
        - [ ] compile JS resources using Laravel Mix 
2. - [ ] Follow instructions from [Traversy Media](https://youtu.be/4pc6cgisbKE) to make a simple laravel resource working.
3. - [ ] Follow instructions about [Full Stack Vue.js & Laravel](https://youtu.be/DJ6PD_jBtU0) and make it work the same way 
        - [ ] do a bit more, bring some Vue Modals, etc...
4. - [ ] import FullCalendar wrapped in VUE and learn how to use it.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.
